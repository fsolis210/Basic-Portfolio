                    <p>    
                        Besides my legal name, close friends of mine call me Nando or even Nan; To me its all
                        same. Born and rasied in San Antonio, Texas and wouldnt have it any other way. 
                        Texas pride runs deep with Texans and im no exception. Everything good in my life that ive done
                        or that has happen to me, is because of my two year old son 'Fernie'. His my partner in crime
                        and brings us so much joy into our lives.

                        Trips to the coast and camping on the Frio River with my 
                        little family is how i like to spend my time. When we cant go out of town, staying home to horse play
                        while the movie 'COCO' plays in the back ground suits us just fine. We take small breaks when my sons 
                        favorite parts come out, mostly during the singing.

                        Other hobbies of mine include Gaming (FPS-PC master race),
                        shooting at the gun range, and most recently trying to fix up our house. DIY projects can be 
                        very fusterating.
